  I have been curious about how systems and networks function, which eventually shaped my career path in the IT field. 
  Outside of work, I enjoy planning tours and programs, participating in blood donation initiatives, and engaging in debates â€” 
  activities that reflect my leadership qualities and commitment to teamwork and community.</p>

  which provided me with a strong foundation in computing, programming, and systems management. My earlier education includes
   HSC in Science from Omargani M. E. S. College and SSC in Science from Kattali Nurul Hoque Chowdhury High School, 
   where I excelled with a GPA of 5.0. Over time, I have continued to expand my knowledge through professional certifications, 
   including CCNA, MTCNA, SAP S/4HANA, and AWS training, ensuring that I stay aligned with industry advancements.</p>
